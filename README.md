# odin-recipes

This project was about creating a recipe page to practice various HTML elements and attributes taught in the Foundation Course of the Odin Project.

To make this project a bit more fun to make I made my recipe website be revolved around Disney themed recipes.

This project demonstrates my understanding of the following HTML content: text-based elements (headings, paragraphs, bold, italic), lists (ordered and unordered), links (relative links) and inserting images.
