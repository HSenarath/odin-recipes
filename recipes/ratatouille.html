    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is inspired by the Disney movie "Ratatouille". 
           One of the most iconic dishes made in this movie by our adorable chef rat 
           was the ratatouille dish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ratatouille is dish of stewed vegetables, originating from Nice. Fun Fact!
            The dish that Remy  makes in the movie, while called Ratatouille, isn't actually
            Ratatouille! How scandalous ~ it's actually a dish that goes by an equally as 
            fancy name, Confit Byaldi, which was created by chef Thomas Keller. Compared to
            Ratatouille, this dish is much more elegant and difficult to recreate (watch out!).

            <li>1 zucchini, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow squash, trimmed and very thinly slices</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</1i>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread tomato paste into the bottom of a 10x10-inch
                baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic and stir
                in 1 tablespoon olive oil and water until thoroughly
                combined. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, 
                yellow squash, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper,
                starting at the outer edge of the dish and working 
                concentrically towards the center. Overlap the slices
                a little to display the colors. Drizzle the vegetables 
                with 3 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and 
                black pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables
                 with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted 
                and tender, about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of 
                mascarpone cheese.</li>
