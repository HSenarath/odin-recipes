    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>'Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?’</p>

        <p>These beautiful Poison Apples! You can make them red, like
           I did (to keep them like the movie’s) or even black or purple
           (to make them even more poisonous!). But I think Snow White wouldn’t
           have gone for the black or purple… I mean, she’s naive and all, but
           she’s not THAT dumb!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>6 Fuji apples (or any other type of firm apples)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
                <li>2 cups sugar</li>
                <li>3/4 cup water</li>
                <li>Food coloring (your choice of color! Red, black or purple
                    work nicely for poison apples)
                </li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry your apples. If there's any moisture left, bubbles can
                     form when you coat them in the candy. Also, make sure they haven't
                     been waxed.</li>
                <li>Insert bamboo skewers in the apples and set them aside.</li>
                <li>Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and grease the paper with butter.</li>
                <li>In a saucepan, combine the corn syrup, the sugar, the water and the
                    food coloring and, over medium high heat, bring the mixture to a boil,
                    stirring until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Once the sugar is dissolved, lower the heat to medium and let it boil,
                    without stirring, until it reaches hard crack stage. Temperature should
                    read 300/310 degrees on a candy thermometer. Another way of knowing is to
                    drip some of the candy in a cup with cold water. If the candy solidifies,
                    it is ready.</li>
                <li>Dip the apples into the candy, swirling them to get rid of any excess,
                    and set them in the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Let them cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
